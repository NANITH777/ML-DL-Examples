# Spam Classification with Naive Bayes

This project aims to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) using a Naive Bayes classifier. It includes data preprocessing steps, feature extraction using the "Bag of Words" approach, and model training and evaluation.

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for building and evaluating a spam classification model. The model is trained using the Naive Bayes algorithm and employs text features extracted from SMS messages.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python 3 installed. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

**Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-classification.git
    cd spam-classification
    ````

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of SMS messages labeled as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam". The `spam.csv` file contains the following columns:
- `v1`: The label of the message (`ham` or `spam`).
- `v2`: The textual content of the message.

The data undergoes preprocessing to be cleaned and prepared for model training.

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Load the dataset**: Read the CSV file and load it into a DataFrame.
2. **Remove unnecessary columns**: Eliminate columns that are not needed for analysis.
3. **Rename columns**: Columns are renamed for better understanding.
4. **Add a length column**: Calculate the length of each message in terms of characters.
5. **Categorize message lengths**: Message lengths are grouped into categories.
6. **Convert labels to numeric format**: The `ham` and `spam` labels are mapped to numerical values to facilitate processing by machine learning algorithms.

## Model Training

The Naive Bayes model is trained using features extracted from the messages. The "Bag of Words" approach is used to convert the messages into a matrix of word counts. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

## Performance Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions on the test set.
- **Precision**: Model's ability to identify only spam messages among those predicted as spam.
- **Recall**: Model's ability to identify all spam messages present in the test set.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing an overall measure of model performance.

## Results

The trained model was evaluated on the test set, with results demonstrating its ability to effectively classify SMS messages as spam or ham. The scores obtained for each metric are as follows:

- **Accuracy**: 98.38565022421525%
- **Precision**: 98.52941176470589%
- **Recall**: 89.33333333333333%
- **F1 Score**: 93.70629370629371%

These results indicate that the model performs well and can be used to effectively filter spam messages.
