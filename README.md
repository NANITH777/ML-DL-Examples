## Overview

This repository features a variety of machine learning, deep learning projects and Natural Language Processing, each stored in its own directory. The projects include applications such as classification, sentiment analysis, fraud detection, and more. Each directory contains the necessary code and resources to run the project, including a detailed README file that explains the project in depth.

## Projects

### ClassificationNN

- **Description:** A simple neural network model for classification tasks. The model can be trained and evaluated on various datasets to perform classification. Explore how neural networks can distinguish between different classes based on features provided in the dataset.

### Covid_19_Vaccine_Sentiment_Analysis

- **Description:** This project analyzes social media data to determine public sentiment towards COVID-19 vaccines using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and sentiment analysis. It involves data collection, text preprocessing, sentiment classification, and result visualization.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

- **Description:** Implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It aims to help financial institutions identify and prevent fraudulent activities.

### Crypto

- **Description:** A project focused on analyzing and predicting cryptocurrency prices using machine learning algorithms. The project includes time-series analysis, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation. The goal is to understand market trends and forecast future prices.

### Email Spam Detection

- **Description:** Uses machine learning to classify emails as spam or not spam. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction (e.g., bag-of-words or TF-IDF), model training, and evaluation. It's a practical application of text classification techniques.

### Hotel Recommendation

- **Description:** Develops a recommendation system for hotels based on user preferences and reviews. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, building a recommendation engine (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering), and evaluation. It aims to help users find hotels that best match their preferences.

### Instagram Impressions

- **Description:** Analyzes Instagram data to predict post impressions and engagement. The project includes data collection from Instagram APIs, feature extraction (e.g., hashtags, content type), model training, and evaluation. It provides insights into factors that drive engagement on social media.

### SMS Spam Detection

- **Description:** Implements a machine learning model to detect spam messages in SMS data. The project covers data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. It's another practical example of text classification in the context of messaging.

### Waiter Tips Prediction

- **Description:** Predicts the amount of tips a waiter might receive based on various factors like service quality, bill amount, and more. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training (e.g., regression analysis), and evaluation. It aims to provide insights into factors influencing tipping behavior.
