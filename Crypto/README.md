## Bitcoin Price Prediction with Auto Time Series (AutoTS)

### Introduction
This project aims to predict the future closing prices of Bitcoin using the Auto Time Series (AutoTS) library in Python. The AutoTS library provides an automated approach to time series forecasting, making it easy to generate accurate predictions for financial data.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Historical Bitcoin price data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library. The closing prices are extracted from the dataset.

2. **Model Initialization**: An instance of the AutoTS class is created with parameters set to forecast the closing prices for the next 30 days.

3. **Model Fitting**: The AutoTS model is trained on the historical Bitcoin price data.

4. **Prediction**: The model generates predictions for the future closing prices of Bitcoin for the next 30 days.

### Prediction Details
The predictions generated by the AutoTS model represent the forecasted closing prices of Bitcoin for the next 30 days. These predictions are based on historical price data and are intended to provide insights into potential future price movements.

### Usage
To replicate the prediction process:
- Run the provided Python script (`predict_bitcoin_price.py`).
- Ensure that the necessary libraries (`autots`, `yfinance`) are installed.
- View the predictions in the generated CSV file (`30daysPrediction.csv`).

### Results
The results of the prediction process can be found in the output CSV file (`30daysPrediction.csv`). Each row in the file represents a date, along with the forecasted closing price of Bitcoin for that date.

### Conclusion
By leveraging the AutoTS library, this project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to predicting the future closing prices of Bitcoin. These predictions can be valuable for traders, investors, and analysts seeking insights into potential price movements in the cryptocurrency market.
