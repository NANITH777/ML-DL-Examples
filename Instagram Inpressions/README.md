## Instagram Data Analysis and Prediction

This project involves analyzing an Instagram dataset to gain insights into various metrics related to post engagement and predicting the number of impressions a post will receive based on several features. The project uses various data visualization techniques and machine learning models to achieve these goals.

### Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- wordcloud
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly wordcloud scikit-learn
```

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `Instagram.csv`. It contains various features such as Likes, Saves, Comments, Shares, Profile Visits, Follows, and Impressions related to Instagram posts.

### Data Analysis

First, the dataset is loaded and some basic exploration is performed:
- Display the first and last few rows of the dataset.
- Check the shape of the dataset.
- List the columns.
- Generate summary statistics.
- Identify missing values.
- Get detailed information about the dataset.

### Data Visualization

The distribution of impressions from different sources (Home, Hashtags, Explore) is visualized using histograms. A pie chart is created to show the total impressions from various sources, providing a clear view of where the impressions are coming from.

### Content Analysis

Word clouds are generated to visualize the most frequent words in the captions and hashtags of the posts. This helps in understanding the common themes and topics in the content being posted.

### Relationship Analysis

Scatter plots with trend lines are created to analyze relationships between impressions and other metrics such as Likes, Comments, Shares, and Saves. These visualizations help in understanding how different engagement metrics correlate with impressions.

### Correlation Analysis

A correlation matrix is generated and visualized using a heatmap to understand the relationships between numerical features. This helps in identifying which features are most strongly related to impressions and could be important predictors.

### Conversion Rate

The conversion rate from profile visits to follows is calculated. A scatter plot with a trend line is created to visualize the relationship between profile visits and followers gained, providing insights into how effective profile visits are in converting to follows.

### Prediction Model

A PassiveAggressiveRegressor model is trained to predict the number of impressions based on likes, saves, comments, shares, profile visits, and follows. The performance of the model is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### Optimization

The model is optimized using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters. The optimized model is then evaluated to see if there is an improvement in performance as measured by the Mean Squared Error.

### Results

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated for both the initial and optimized models to evaluate their performance. A lower MSE indicates a better-performing model. The results of the analysis and predictions can help in improving post engagement and making data-driven decisions.
